# Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a multi-layered project using Onion Architecture, emphasizing code quality and maintainability. This project will incorporate various design patterns and best practices, including the Repository Pattern, Unit of Work, and Singleton Pattern. It will leverage Entity Framework Core for database interactions and include comprehensive user and role management using Microsoft ASP.NET Identity. Additionally, the project will involve integrating a pre-built theme, utilizing JavaScript libraries like jQuery DataTables and Toaster JS, and implementing a full-featured admin dashboard for managing the project.

## Key Features and Development Focus

1. **Onion Architecture:**
   - Build a multi-layered architecture that separates concerns and promotes a clean, maintainable codebase.
   - Layers will include Core, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation.

2. **Repository Pattern and Unit of Work:**
   - Implement the Repository Pattern to abstract data access logic, making the code more testable and maintainable.
   - Use the Unit of Work pattern to coordinate multiple repositories, ensuring transactions are managed correctly.

3. **Singleton Pattern:**
   - Utilize the Singleton Pattern where appropriate to ensure a class has only one instance, providing a global point of access to it.

4. **Entity Framework Core:**
   - Handle database interactions using Entity Framework Core, allowing for seamless integration with the database.
   - Use code-first migrations and ensure proper mapping of entities to the database.

5. **Theme Integration:**
   - Integrate a pre-built theme into the project.
   - Customize the theme to match the projectâ€™s requirements, ensuring it works well with ASP.NET Core.

6. **User and Role Management:**
   - Implement user and role management using Microsoft ASP.NET Identity.
   - Provide functionalities for user registration, login, role assignment, and permissions management.

7. **JavaScript Libraries:**
   - Use jQuery DataTables for handling dynamic tables with features like sorting, searching, and pagination.
   - Integrate Toaster JS for displaying user-friendly notifications.

8. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Develop an admin dashboard that allows system administrators to manage the project.
   - Include features for managing users, roles, products, orders, and other essential components.

9. **Pagination:**
   - Implement pagination to manage large sets of products across multiple pages.
   - Ensure the pagination is user-friendly and integrated with search and filter functionalities.

10. **Session Management:**
    - Manage user sessions effectively, ensuring data is maintained across user interactions with the site.

11. **Online Payments with Stripe:**
    - Enable online payments using the Stripe payment gateway.
    - Implement secure payment processing, handling payment confirmations and errors gracefully.

12. **Publishing to Monester:**
    - Deploy the project on Monester, ensuring the deployment process is smooth and the application is optimized for the platform.

13. **Data Seeding:**
    - Seed initial data for the admin role and users to ensure the system starts with essential data, improving ease of testing and initial use.
